# AutoApollo

This is a small program designed to determine whether to perform a check-in based on the national holiday schedule stored in data.csv. Developed using Playwright and integrated with Python, Windows Task Manager, and Line Notify, this program automates the check-in process. Upon successfully checking in, it sends notifications and provides screenshots of the successful check-in.

Important: Please ensure that your computer remains awake and is not shut down or put into sleep mode during the execution of this program.
